### **Deployment**

#### **Steps for Deployment**
1. **Build the Project**:
   - Ensure assets are optimized using Webpack.
   - Run the build command:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
     This generates a `dist` folder with production-ready files.

2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   - Sign up or log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
   - Connect your Git repository or drag-and-drop the `dist` folder.
   - Configure deployment settings:
     - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
     - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - Netlify will deploy the site and provide you with a live URL.

3. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Use image compression tools (e.g., [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)) to optimize large images.
   - Lazy loading is already implemented to improve performance.

### **Notes on Webpack Configuration**

- **Lazy Loading**:  
  Implemented via JavaScript to defer the loading of images until they are nearly in view.
  
- **Asset Management**:  
  Webpack bundles CSS, JavaScript, and copies images to the `dist` folder for efficient deployment.
  
- **Plugins Used**:
  - `MiniCssExtractPlugin`: Extracts and bundles CSS.
  - `HtmlWebpackPlugin`: Generates the final HTML file with linked assets.
  - `CopyWebpackPlugin`: Copies static assets (images, fonts, etc.) to the build folder.
